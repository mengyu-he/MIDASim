Title: Simulating Realistic Microbiome Data using 'MIDASim'
Version: 2.0
Description: The 'MIDASim' package is a microbiome data simulator for generating realistic microbiome datasets by adapting a user-provided template. It supports the controlled introduction of experimental signals-such as shifts in taxon relative abundances, prevalence, and sample library sizes-to create distinct synthetic populations under diverse simulation scenarios. For more details, see He et al. (2024) <doi:10.1186/s40168-024-01822-z>.
